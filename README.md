# ProjManager
An app to manage project directories.
This is a graphical port of [cli-project-manager](https://github.com/amin-not-found/cli-project-manager).

## Usage
You need dotnet sdk to run this project. You can build it like this:

```
Then you can run the built program from `bin` directory.
